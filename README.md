# Maciej Lewi≈Ñski's Portfolio

I'd like to welcome You to my personal home page. I hope that You will find something interesting on my site.

This page contains most of my work, on which i'm still evolving. Nothing is 100% completed, as it's always an opportunity to improve one something.

As for now, You will find here:
 - 2 webpages on which I'm working on (one personal and one for my wife who is a photographer)
 - simple JS Apps, using basic functions and API access
 - "Inter Web Face" project, which is an interactive webpage, but can also be used as an addition for most Apps or webpages, as metrics panel or site/app management. You can try a demo [here](https://maciejlewinski.github.io/InterWebFace.github.io/)
 - ...and more to come in future (up next: Diet App build in React)

## Technologies
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS Grid, Flexbox
- SCSS
- Bootstrap
- React (in future, project ongoing)
